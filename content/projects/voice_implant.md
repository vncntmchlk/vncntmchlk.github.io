Piece for voice, live-electronics and visualisation (2021)
<!--more-->

This piece was made in 2021 as part of the project **IMAGINARY REAL**. It was premiered on 09.10.2021 in Sprengel Museum Hannover.
The visualisation is depicting the processes of the live-electronics, which were controlled in realtime, loosely following a score.
The score is a structure for an improvisation between the singer and the live-electronics player.
