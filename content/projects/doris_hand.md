Live-electronics performance in collaboration with dancer/violinist iSaAc EH  (2018-)

<!--more-->

Since 2018 [iSaAc EH](http://www.isaacespinoza.eu/) and i have been working with diy motion sensors to create a performance piece, where the performer is controlling the sound with their motion. It has been an ongoing collaboration. A first version premiered at the NOW! Festival in Essen (2018), with later performances at the HoerenSehen Festival in Bremen and at the KunstKulturKirche in Frankfurt (both 2019).
